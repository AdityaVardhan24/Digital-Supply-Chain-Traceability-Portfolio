## 🚀 About The Portfolio
As a **Cloud & CSE Graduate (2025)**, I bridge the gap between **Technology** and **Supply Chain Operations**.

Most portfolios focus on generic coding. This portfolio focuses on **Regulatory Compliance** and **Data Interoperability**. It contains technical implementations for:
1.  **ESPR (Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation)**
2.  **Scope 3 Carbon Footprint Tracking (ISO 14067)**
3.  **Master Data Governance (GS1 GPC Standards)**

## 📂 Project 1: GS1 Master Data Governance
**Goal:** Clean and standardize raw product data for global interoperability.
* **Tech Stack:** Advanced Excel, GS1 GPC Taxonomy, Data Validation Logic.
* **Key Outcome:** Achieved **100% Data Quality Score** by normalizing raw attributes (Weight, Dimensions) to **ISO Units** (GRM, KGM) and mapping them to Global Product Classification (GPC) Brick Codes.

## 📂 Project 2: Digital Product Passports (DPP)
**Goal:** Create regulatory-compliant "Digital Twins" for EV Batteries & Textiles.
* **Tech Stack:** JSON-LD, GS1 Digital Link, QR Code Generation.
* **Key Outcome:** Architected Passports compliant with the **EU Battery Regulation**. Modeled critical data points including **Cobalt Origin (CRM)**, **Carbon Footprint**, and **Recycled Content %**.
